# Data Engineering

**Definition:** \
Data engineering is the process of designing, building, and maintaining systems for collecting, storing, transforming, and making data accessible for analysis, decision-making, and other purposes.

### Key concepts in data engineering include:

- **Data Cleansing**: Removing inaccuracies and inconsistencies from data to improve its quality.
- **Data Modeling**: Designing data structures representing business processes and supporting data analytics.
- **Data Pipeline**: Automated workflows that move data from one system to another for processing and storage.
- **Data Security**: Implementing measures to protect data from unauthorized access and breaches.
- **Data Warehouse**: Centralized repositories for storing large volumes of structured data, optimized for querying and analysis.
- **DataLake**: A storage repository that holds vast amounts of raw data in its native format until needed.
- **Data Accessibility**: Ensuring data is easily accessible to authorized users when needed.
- **Big Data**: Handling and analyzing extremely large datasets that traditional data processing software cannot manage efficiently.
- **Cloud Engineering**: Designing and managing scalable, reliable cloud-based data systems.

### Key elements of data engineering:

#### 1. Data extraction/collection:

The creation of systems and processes to extract data of varying formats from multiple sources.

#### 2. Data ingestion:

Data ingestion involves data source identification as well as data validation, indexing, cataloging, and formatting.

#### 3. Data storage:

Data engineers take ingested data and design the necessary storage solutions to house it. These solutions include everything from a cloud data warehouse, to a data lake, or even a NoSQL database.

#### 4. Data transformation:

Conversion of raw data via data cleaning, enrichment, and integration with other sources.

#### 5. Data modeling:

The process of designing and structuring data within a database or data warehouse.
It involves creating a visual representation of the data, including its entities, attributes, and relationships, to ensure data consistency, quality, and effective management.

#### 6. Data quality:

Making sure that data is accurate and accessible is another key element of data engineering.

#### 7. Data governance:

Validation rules and processes to ensure that organizational data governance policies are adhered to and data integrity is maintained.
